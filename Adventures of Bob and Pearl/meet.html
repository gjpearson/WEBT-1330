                    <p>Pearl is a 2024 Honda Ridgeline that we purchased from Scott Cass at East TN Auto Outlet in Etowah, TN.  It’s no secret in our home that Glenda LOVES a nice truck and she only wanted the Obsidian Blue Pearl color... hence our name choice of “Pearl”.</p>

                    <p>Pearl is a comfortable ride with plenty of leg room in the back.  But our favorite part is the tailgate drops down or swings out.  Easy access.  There’s an additional bonus of a deep covered trunk at the back of the bed. Lots of travel storage. </p>

                        <p>Of course, our favorite feature on Bob is the windows.  It’s like living in a treehouse.  But when the sun goes down after watching it set, we close our privacy curtains and await another day of adventure.</p>

                        <p>Bob is a 2025 Alto R1713 which we purchased from Safari Condo in Quebec City, Canada in October 2024.  SC is a small family owned manufacturer so we were on the waitlist for two 1/2 years.  But he was well worth the wait.  A teardrop camper which fits in our garage but has a 7ft headspace when open.</p>
