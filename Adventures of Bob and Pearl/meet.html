                    <p>Pearl is a 2024 Honda Ridgeline that we purchased from Scott Cass at East TN Auto Outlet in Etowah, TN.  It’s no secret in our home that Glenda LOVES a nice truck and she only wanted the Obsidian Blue Pearl color... hence our name choice of “Pearl”.</p>

                    <p>Pearl is a comfortable ride with plenty of leg room in the back.  But our favorite part is the tailgate drops down or swings out.  Easy access.  There’s an additional bonus of a deep covered trunk at the back of the bed. Lots of travel storage. </p>
