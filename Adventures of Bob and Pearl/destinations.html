                            <p>Delaware State Forest is a 85,114-acre Pennsylvania state forest in Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry District #19.  The Delaware State Forest is an ideal location to spend a night outdoors. These campsites in remote portions of the Pocono region allow for memorable trips dominated by dark night skies and solitude. Trails and other points of interest with scenic streams, lakes, and forests also offer daytime adventure. We reserved E-013 which was quiet, secluded with a picnic table and fire ring.  Note, there are no hookups at these locations. Reservations can be made here: https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/welcome.do</p>

                    <p>Shenandoah National Park is a land bursting with cascading waterfalls, spectacular vistas, fields of wildflowers, and quiet wooded hollows. With over 200,000 acres of protected lands that are haven to deer, songbirds, and black bear, there's so much to explore...and your journey begins right here! We made reservations at the Loft Mountain Campground. Loft Mountain (mile 79.5) sits atop Big Flat Mountain in the southern part of Shenandoah National Park, with outstanding views to east and west. The campground has a combination of reservable and first-come, first-served sites. Reservable sites are released in sections and can be checked here: https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/camping.html</p>
